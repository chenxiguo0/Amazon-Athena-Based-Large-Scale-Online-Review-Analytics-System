Now you may think \"aw yea Mr genius, anyone could have told me that\", but I'm not done XD. You can restrict how many calories you eat by making yourself feel more full with eating less calorie dense food, and more fibrous food. So if you eat less carbs (I think it's really hard to go no carbs so maybe just try to do less then normal), and then try to cook more veggies and make yourself full from that, you could tip the scale that way.

You are literally saying that we should not give people free access to knowledge, because they might use that knowledge to do harm. You want to limit access to knowledge. You want only select few to be in control of knowledge. You can already use internet to learn hacking, learn building bombs, learn to make firearms, learn how to scam etc. And we have legal system to deal with people that use knowledge in nefarious ways.

IMO this is what governments should be talking about, not abstract armageddon scenarios. AI (and automation and cybernetics in general) cannot be rejected in a capitalist society because it offers a radical increase in profit by reducing a core aspect of the costs of production (human labor) towards zero. In so doing, AI also destroys capitalism, since wealth is tied to labor in the system; ie, no labor costs = no laborers = no workers with wealth = no consumers. These immediate and foreseeable effects of AI on capitalist and democratic socialist societies can be prevented before people suffer, but it requires the political will to restructure entire economies so that income and wealth are decoupled from labor.

So when asked to reverse a word like \"lollipop,\" the model interprets it as a sequence of tokens, such as \\[\"l\", \"olli\", \"pop\"\\].

That argument will make it show you the token IDs in the prompt. Once you know the token ID for `</s>` then you can use `-l 123-inf` (where 123 is the ID you found) to set the probability for that token to -infinity, effectively banning it. You can use that approach to ban other tokens as well. In this particular case, banning `</s>` might prevent the model from ending its response, so depending on what you want to do, the other person's reply may be more helpful.

You have an advantage there, go for it! The entry barrier will be much lower for you there. You mostly need C and C++ programming knowledge, in addition to what you probably already know. Of course, formal CS or software engineering degree wouldn't hurt, but is not strictly required if you would have a good portfolio of projects and online courses.

Perhaps I should have said ‚Äúfirst widely followed monotheistic‚Äù religions. It‚Äôs very obvious that the abstract single-God model of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam was a huge step forward in the spiritual realm. Humankind had grown beyond worshipping icons and oceans, volcanos, etc. That‚Äôs why Abrahamic religions took over the world. Probably 75% of the world now follows Abrahamic religions (pretty much everyone except majority of India and China). I am curious what the next step in this spiritual evolution will be. We won‚Äôt see it. I don‚Äôt expect much fundamental change in the next few hundred years. Religious evolution is very slow. Probably, the next step is the reform of Islam (like the reform Christianity went through). Even that may take more than 100 years.
