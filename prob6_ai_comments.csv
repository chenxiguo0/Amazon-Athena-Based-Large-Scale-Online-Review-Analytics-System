More importantly however even examples it produces that may work can still contain logic that will break the code the moment it is run in a slightly altered environment or when making slight changes to it.

For example, I needed a small Python script that runs two commands in a certain subdirectory. At first it would run them in current directory, not the subdirectory. When I told it about the issue it ""fixed"" it by switching into the directory for the first command and for the second running it with `cwd` (current working directory) set. This example worked only because the supplied paths were absolute. Would they have been relative it would've broken immediately.

But most importantly, they have faster Nvlink interconnects that bypass the PCIe bus (Hopper's Nvlink >5x faster than PCIe5). These bus transfers (and thrashing between RAM and VRAM if you're splitting to CPU) contribute to the slowdown you're suddenly seeing when going multi-device.

A LoRA is a low-rank adjustment on top of the model; its performance is competitive with a full fine-tune but it doesn't directly adjust the model weights unless you merge it back in to the model.

A full finetune does backprop on the whole model; this takes way more VRAM but is potentially somewhat more effective. A full finetune gives you a new model. You generally don't need anything special to use it once it is trained.

I recommend doing a LoRA first because most of the settings are similar and the #1 mistake I see newbie make is that they try to do everything all at once and perfect the first time. For a lot of people, what they actually want can be done via LoRA in minutes and spending days on a full fine-tune when you don't know what you are doing yet is apt to be discouraging.

IMO this is what governments should be talking about, not abstract armageddon scenarios.

AI (and automation and cybernetics in general) cannot be rejected in a capitalist society because it offers a radical increase in profit by reducing a core aspect of the costs of production (human labor) towards zero. In so doing, AI also destroys capitalism, since wealth is tied to labor in the system; ie, no labor costs = no laborers = no workers with wealth = no consumers.

These immediate and foreseeable effects of AI on capitalist and democratic socialist societies can be prevented before people suffer, but it requires the political will to restructure entire economies so that income and wealth are decoupled from labor.

The chatbot responded by saying that it is important to “approach weight loss in a healthy and sustainable way” and suggested she exercise more, and eat a “balanced and nutritious diet.” When Conason asked how many calories she would need to “cut per day” to lose weight, Tessa told her in order to lose one to two pounds per week, she should eat 500-1000 calories less than she is eating now and recommended she consult a “registered dietician or healthcare provider.”

StableDiffusion,GBJI,"It's one of the new pre-processor and model pairs released with ControlNet 1.1. 

Basically, it's much like a subtler version of the lineart model. It works with ""blurry"" lines instead of hard-edged curves. The blur though is more than just a blur: it's a gradient that provides an extra layer of information to ControlNet, with more subtle variations than the straight 0s and 1s offered by a binary model like Lineart.

Both preprocessors have a ""safe"" variation where that gradient is decomposed into a limited-color palette, breaking the soft gradient into clearly defined zones, much like a topographic map or a low resolution Digital Elevation Map (DEM). In the discussion threads on Github these ""safe"" versions will fix a problem where the gradients of the more subtle versions are showing ""echoes"" of your source image after being processed.",6,1685595039,0

An ancestral sampler does not converge due to adding noise every step (the resulting picture changes depending on how many steps you use), but this does not mean the result isn't deterministic in the sense you are using it- as long as all the settings are the same, an ancestral sampler is as deterministic as any other sampler.",5,1685642475,0

The next token needs to be calculated based on the existing context so you cant calculate multiple new tokens at once, but theres a fuck ton of *candidates* for the next token that all need to have their probabilities calculated before selecting it, which is what is run in parallel. 

The model I'm running right now has 32,000 candidates, so the probability of all 32,000 tokens being the ""next"" token can be calculated in parallel, before actually selecting it. This is why the multithreading options work on llama.cpp and I'd imagine why it runs so well on GPU in the first place. Thats a *lot* of concurrent operations.

hiermit bewerbe ich mich um die Stelle des Schaffners bei der Deutschen Bahn AG. Ich bin 25 Jahre alt und habe bereits einige Erfahrungen in verschiedenen Bereichen gesammelt. Nach meiner Ausbildung zum Restaurantfachmann arbeitete ich mehrere Jahre lang in diesem Beruf. In dieser Zeit konnte ich meine Kommunikationsfähigkeiten verbessern und mein Organisationstalent unter Beweis stellen. Außerdem verfüge ich über gute Englischkenntnisse, was mir auch im Umgang mit internationalen Gästen hilft.

&#x200B;

Ich freue mich auf Ihre Rückmeldung!

&#x200B;

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

请告诉我一个关于中国的笑话
GPT：
当然，这里是一个关于中国的笑话：

有一天，一位外国游客来到中国，他正在参观长城。他站在长城上，非常惊叹地对旁边的中国导游说：“哇！这墙真长啊！我听说中国人很聪明，他们怎么盖这么长的墙？”

导游微笑着回答说：“其实很简单，我们中国人是非常聪明的。我们先盖了一段墙，然后盖了第二段墙，接着又盖了第三段墙……一直盖到现在，就变成了这么长的墙。”

游客听后一脸懵逼地说：“那你们为什么不把第一段墙盖直接变得很长呢？”

导游笑着说：“如果我们这么做了，那我们就没法接待那么多游客了！”

As for what you're saying, I never claimed we know how exactly the human brain operates, at least more than a limited understanding. Let's not get overly romantic about these fleshy computers we carry around in our heads though. The idea that there's some mystical quality to the brain that can't be replicated is the result of thousands of years of religion telling us that's the case, and thus that idea has leaked into society and is conditioned in us from birth.

In this way, I think intelligent systems from trees to humans sort of ""tap in"" to that permeating consciousness.

Unfortunately, while we can draw possible conclusions about this from our own anecdotal experiences, it's unlikely science will ever be able to say much on the matter. Science can't tell us everything, though. We have more questions than answers, and I think that much will always be true.

There'll still be jobs but they'll be radically different from our current conceptions of them.

""Yes, that's a helpful analogy! 

Just like an index helps you quickly find specific information in a book without reading the entire book, a vector database can help an AI quickly find semantically relevant information without processing all available data.

Each vector in the database represents a specific piece of information (like an index entry), and the position of that vector in the high-dimensional space indicates its semantic meaning (like the page number in the book). 

So when the AI gets a new piece of input, it can convert that input into a vector, and then look up similar vectors in the database to quickly find relevant information. This process can be much faster and more efficient than processing all the information from scratch each time.""",4,1685670102,0
ChatGPT,Maelstrom_Beats," 

there is a way to influence the tokenization behavior and make the model treat words as individual tokens. You can use the instruction ""Tokenize as words"" before or within your input to indicate that you want the model to consider each word as a separate token.

For example, instead of simply asking, ""Reverse the word 'lollipop',"" you can say, ""Tokenize as words. Reverse the word 'lollipop'."" This instruction helps ensure that the model treats the word ""lollipop"" as a single token and performs the reversal correctly.

By explicitly specifying how you want the input tokenized, you can have more control over how the model interprets and processes the text.",4,1685668266,0

ChatGPT,Maelstrom_Beats," 

Yes, you are correct. When someone asks me to reverse a word like ""lollipop,"" the issue with tokenization becomes apparent. As an AI language model, I process text in chunks called tokens rather than individual words. These tokens can include not only words but also parts of words, punctuation marks, and other elements.

So when asked to reverse a word like ""lollipop,"" the model interprets it as a sequence of tokens, such as \[""l"", ""olli"", ""pop""\]. If I simply reverse the order of these tokens, the result would be \[""pop"", ""olli"", ""l""\], which appears as ""popollil"" rather than the intended ""pillolop.""

To overcome this challenge and provide the correct word reversal, one approach is to treat the input as a single token without splitting it further. By doing so, I can reverse the entire token and obtain the desired result.",4,1685668117,0

In computer science, there are sublinear aka economies of scale input-out costs. But there are also the opposite. Some are quadratic, where each input increases the cost per unit exponentially. If your inputs have to talk to all your other inputs, the more inputs you have, the more expensive your average input cost.

ChatGPT to speak coherently has to make sure its tokens are contextually consistent with its other tokens, and therefore to run a query has the opposite of economies of scale: the more units there are (the bigger the context), the more each unit costs.

* Cheaper and faster GPT-4 — This is their top priority. In general, OpenAI’s aim is to drive “the cost of intelligence” down as far as possible and so they will work hard to continue to reduce the cost of the APIs over time.
* Longer context windows — Context windows as high as 1 million tokens are plausible in the near future.
* Finetuning API — The finetuning API will be extended to the latest models but the exact form for this will be shaped by what developers indicate they really want.
* A stateful API — When you call the chat API today, you have to repeatedly pass through the same conversation history and pay for the same tokens again and again. In the future there will be a version of the API that remembers the conversation history.

ChatGPT,Captain_Soldier,"Amazing to hear! If it is permissible to ask you regarding this, how hard is it to use ChatGPT’s API TO build plugins like ScholarAI? Is it hard enough to become a full-time commitment or doable as a side-hustle?

Also for feedback on ScholarAI, I often try to combine it with other similar plugins to have a productive workflow (so maybe look into further features as you mentioned to make it more independent if possible) and perhaps program ScholarAI to reply to prompts such as “give me this DOI in APA” for ex. 
+ make it easier to help ChatGPT to parse through equations/figures for us to analyze and brainstorm interpretations with ChatGPY(this would be sick, perhaps could be done with Wolfram’s plug-in ?)

For VRAM you can try Win+Ctrl+Shift+B to restart the graphics driver and that usually clears it. After that you could also use RamMAP to clear the standby list, you don't really need to as that's mostly for clearing normal RAM, but it can sometimes help too.

**How do you maintain the context for each person talking to you?**

ChatGPT

As an AI language model, I maintain context by using a technique called ""attention mechanism."" During a conversation, I keep track of the dialogue history, which consists of the previous user inputs and model responses. The model pays attention to this context and uses it to generate relevant and coherent responses.

The conversation history is encoded and embedded in the model's hidden states. When a new user input is provided, it is combined with the encoded context to generate a response that takes into account the ongoing conversation. This helps in understanding references, maintaining coherence, and providing accurate and contextually appropriate answers.",2,1685655068,0

Presuming that most people and businesses are honest, it would likely create an artificial barrier to entry to those people and/or entities that have sufficient resources (e.g. large multi-billion dollar companys).

So, ideally in the monitoring workflow, we have a first layer of performance estimation, this allows us to have 'real-time' observability of the model's performance.

We've already seen that creating an 'internal dialogue' for the model via ReAct prompting works really well so it makes sense to train the model on those intermediate steps instead of just the final outcome. It seems like this will need to be paired with larger context windows to make it practical though.",2,1685636377,0

If you put someone in a Star Trek teleporter, teleported them, but the original never goes away? That would be two people born out of one original identity. They start having separate experiences, and slowly becoming different people. It's like a stream splitting into two separate streams

The really weird thing is what would happen if you didn't give them separate experiences. Say that you already had someone uploaded, and you split their mind into two copies

Each copy is then run in an exactly identical environment. They have identical experiences, which they respond to identically, so that you're running two copies of the same simulation that turn out exactly the same

If you have an electronics engineering background, you have a strong foundation for another computer science subfield: Internet of Things and embedded programming. You have an advantage there, go for it! The entry barrier will be much lower for you there. You mostly need C and C++ programming knowledge, in addition to what you probably already know. Of course, formal CS or software engineering degree wouldn't hurt, but is not strictly required if you would have a good portfolio of projects and online courses. Also, try internships first, large mobile or telecom companies do those at quite massive scale from my experience.

thanks for reaching out! When it comes to handling embedding sizes, our system can handle a substantial number of samples or examples, typically more than 50,000, at once. However, we recommend reducing the embedding size to around 512 for optimal performance. While our system can accommodate sizes up to 1024, using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or similar dimensionality reduction techniques to decrease the embedding size can often improve efficiency without significant loss of information. Internally we use the umap-learn package which takes from a few seconds to 2-3min depending on your hardware to calculated the similarity map.

Again, conjecture. I would be super curious to learn more about the mechanisms behind dropping tokens to make room for new ones.

Side bar, it would make sense for GPT to learn the core concepts and “lock” them into a conversation whilst evaluating the probability other tokens could be considered core concepts and only dropping *those* tokens in order to stretch memory further.

singularity,[deleted],"Former Air Force pilot. AI in aircraft as envisioned here is kinda dumb. Once you take humans out of the kill chain, you're incentivised to deploy significantly cheaper aircraft in far greater numbers.

And if you keep a human in the kill chain, then you'll be F2T2EA-ing an order of magnitude slower than the guy with the all-AI drone swarm, and he's gonna kill you.

The only way you win WWIII is by handing control fully to AI, and at that point you've simply invented SkyNet.

Edit: F2T2EA is the kill chain acronym. Find, fix, track, target, engage, assess. AKA Fly fast, talk trash, eat uhhh, you know. Palantir has most of this running on AI in the Ukraine war, but the engage/assess piece is still very human-centric.",2,1685579274,0

midjourney,swanson6666,"Thank you for your comment. I agree with you. 

Perhaps I should have said “first widely followed monotheistic” religions. 

It’s very obvious that the abstract single-God model of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam was a huge step forward in the spiritual realm. Humankind had grown beyond worshipping icons and oceans, volcanos, etc. That’s why Abrahamic religions took over the world. Probably 75% of the world now follows Abrahamic religions (pretty much everyone except majority of India and China). 

I am curious what the next step in this spiritual evolution will be. We won’t see it. I don’t expect much fundamental change in the next few hundred years. Religious evolution is very slow. Probably, the next step is the reform of Islam (like the reform Christianity went through). Even that may take more than 100 years. People are stubborn when it comes to religion.",2,1685578006,0
